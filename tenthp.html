            <h2>Nihari: Pakistan's National Dish</h2>
            <p>
                    The word “Nihar” originated from the Arabic word, “Nahar” which means “morning”. It was originally eaten by Nawabs in the Mughal Empire as a breakfast item after their morning prayers.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    Nihari was developed in Old Delhi, India, during the reign of the Mughal Empire. Muslim Nawabs (Noblemen) would eat Nihari after their sunrise prayers (Fajr), after which they would take naps 
                until the afternoon Muslim prayers (Zhuhr). It later became a regular breakfast dish for the working class due to its energy-boosting properties.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    Nihari used to be slow-cooked overnight in large pots in order to be given to labourers when they participated in the substantial construction projects sanctioned by the empire. 
                Nihari was served free to labourers.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    After Pakistan gained its independence in 1947, a huge wave of immigrants from Delhi settled in Karachi. As many of these immigrants were already involved in the food industry, restaurants 
                were quickly established in Karachi.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    When classically prepared, Nihari used to take approximately 6-8 hours just to stew, not to mention preparation time. Thankfully, with the help of modern technology and methods, it is much easier to 
                achieve the same result in less time.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                To make Nihari Masala:

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 1
                To make your own Nihari masala from scratch, dry roast all the whole spices for the masala; cool; and grind them to a fine powder.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                To make Nihari curry:

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 1
                Heat Ghee (you can use oil as well but ghee makes it tastier) in a deep bottom stock pot. Once the ghee is hot, add the sliced onions and fry till they start to turn brown.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 2
                Add mutton pieces, ginger paste, garlic paste, coriander powder, turmeric powder and salt. Mix well to coat the mutton in ghee and spices. Sauté for 5 mins.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 3
                Add the nihari masala and 8 cups of water. Mix well, cover and cook on very low heat for about 4 hours until the meat is tender. Keep checking in between. The way to know that the meat is cooked 
                is when it breaks easily with a wooden spoon.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 4
                Dissolve wheat flour in half cup of water such that there are no lumps. Slowly add it to the gravy. Stir to mix it well in the gravy and let it simmer for another 10-15 mins till the gravy thickens.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 5
                Sprinkle some lime juice and garnish with ginger strips and fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot.

    <em>Engineers With Passion For Food, We Plan, Work and Eat</em>
    <p>
        Everyone likes food. However, there are some people who truly love eating, just like us because of the relaxation and happiness 
        that something as simple as food brings can't be replicated. It's just like when something bad happens in your studies or work, 
        but when you eat your "comfort food," you somehow feel relieved and happier.  Another, example is sharing meals with family and friends, 
        where the conversation deepens and you feel the strong connection while enjoying eating. 
        These are just some of the reasons why food became our passion, because what we eat affects how we feel. 
        Food should make us feel good. It tastes great and nourishes our bodies.
