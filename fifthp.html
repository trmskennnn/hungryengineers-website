            <h2>Pot-Au-Feu: France's National Dish</h2>
            <p>
                <br/>
                <br/>

                    Simply put, this French classic is a stew-like dish of boiled meat and vegetables. However, it is not as simple as it might appear at first glance. Pot-au-feu, French for “pot on fire”, 
                is one of the oldest French peasant winter dishes. 
                <br/>
                <br/>

                    It was originally made over an open fire with cheap, inferior cuts of meat, vegetables such as potatoes, onions, carrots, leeks and turnips, and whatever other ingredients were available. 
                The result was a savory stew that helped one make it through the cold season.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    The use of tough cuts of meat and low cooking temperature means a long cooking time to make the meat tender, sometimes even an entire day. The dish is traditionally considered finished when 
                the broth gets a gelatinous texture. As it is one of the most popular dishes in France, every region expectedly has its own twist on the dish, however, the common thread among all of them is 
                that the broth is served first and the meat second.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    With its wonderful aromas and succulent, tender meat, a serving of pot-au-feu paired with a glass of dry red wine is an authentic experience that is more than worth the time invested in preparing it.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>

                Procedures:

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 1:
                In a large pot, combine the onion and half each of the leeks, celery and carrots. Set the beef shanks and rump roast on top of the vegetables. Wrap the parsley, thyme and bay leaves in a piece 
                of moistened cheesecloth and tie into a bundle. Add the bundle to the pot along with the peppercorns and 1 tablespoon of kosher salt. Add 2 of the marrow bones and the water. 
                Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover partially and simmer, skimming occasionally, until the rump roast is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 2:
                Transfer the shanks and roast to a large bowl and cover. Strain the broth and return it to the pot. Boil over high heat until reduced to 10 cups, about 45 minutes; skim off the fat.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 3:
                Add the remaining leeks, celery, and carrots to the broth along with the parsnips, turnips and rutabagas. Cover and simmer over low heat until the vegetables are just tender, 30 minutes. 
                Add the remaining 6 to 8 marrow bones and the potatoes. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender, 40 minutes.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 4:
                Untie the rump roast and cut it across the grain into 6 to 8 slices. Cut the shank meat into 2-inch chunks; add the meats to the pot and simmer until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. 
                Ladle the broth into shallow bowls. Add the meats, marrow bones and vegetables and serve, passing horseradish, mustard, and sour cream at the table.

    <em>Engineers With Passion For Food, We Plan, Work and Eat</em>
    <p>
        Everyone likes food. However, there are some people who truly love eating, just like us because of the relaxation and happiness 
        that something as simple as food brings can't be replicated. It's just like when something bad happens in your studies or work, 
        but when you eat your "comfort food," you somehow feel relieved and happier.  Another, example is sharing meals with family and friends, 
        where the conversation deepens and you feel the strong connection while enjoying eating. 
        These are just some of the reasons why food became our passion, because what we eat affects how we feel. 
        Food should make us feel good. It tastes great and nourishes our bodies.
