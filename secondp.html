            <h2>Haggis: Scotland's National Dish</h2>
            <p>Haggis is a traditional Scottish dish. Extremely well known, it is perhaps the one food which most represents Scotland. 
                Traditionally, the haggis is cooked in a sheep's stomach, rather like a very large oval sausage. The haggis was the subject of the Robert Burns' poem, 
                Address To A Haggis, which is recited while the haggis is marched in, accompanied by bagpipes, to be served at a Burns supper.   

                <br/>
                <br/>
                
                The haggis is an example of human ingenuity in using every part of an animal for food, in a way that preserves the meat without spoiling for later consumption and in a manner that allows 
                transportation. Also, the haggis has become a cultural icon. Its contents and preparation reflect the Scottish trait of thriftiness. 
                Its popularity among expatriates is evidence of pride in their culture, particularly as represented by Robert Burns. Well-known throughout the world as typical Scottish fare, 
                yet rather enigmatic in origin and flavor, the haggis also reflects not only the mystique but also the humor of the Scots, as tourists are often teased 
                and tricked with tales of the fictional Wild Haggis.

                Recipes/Ingredients: Traditional Haggis

                <br/>
                <br/>

                1 ox bung
                <br/>
                1.4kg lamb's pluck, (heart, lungs and liver)
                <br/>
                500g of beef, or lamb trimmings or stewing steak
                <br/>
                200g of suet
                <br/>
                500g of oatmeal (coarse)
                <br/>
                SEASONING (ADJUST TO TASTE)
                <br/>
                2 tbsp of black pepper, ground
                <br/>
                1 nutmeg, finely grated
                <br/>
                4 tbsp of coriander seeds
                <br/>
                4 tbsp of fine sea salt

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Procedures:

                <br/>
                <br/>
                Step 1:
                Rinse the whole pluck in cold water. Trim off any large pieces of fat and cut away the windpipe.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 2:
                Place in a good sized pot and cover with cold water. The lungs float, so keep submerged with a plate or a lid. 
                Bring to the boil and skim the surface regularly. Gently simmer for 2 hours

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 3:
                Lift the meat from the pot with tongs or a slotted spoon, and rinse in cold water to remove any scum. Place into a bowl and leave to cool.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 4:
                Strain cooking liquid through a fine sieve and put back on the stove to reduce until you have roughly 500–1l of stock. Leave to cool.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 5:
                Whilst the stock reduces, finely dice the cooked heart and lungs. Grate the liver using the coarse side of the grater. Finely dice the trimmings.
                Mix together in a large bowl, along with the suet, oatmeal and spices.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 6:
                Measure how much stock remains from cooking the pluck, and make up to 1l with cold water. When cool, add to the haggis mixture.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 7:
                To check the seasoning, pan fry a tablespoon of the mixture for 2–3 minutes and taste. Add any extra salt, pepper or spice if needed.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 8:
                Spoon the haggis mixture into the soaked, rinsed ox bung. Be aware the filling swells as it cooks, so pack quite loosely, and keep a little bung at each end.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 9:
                When the haggis is the size required, expel any extra air, pinch, tie with string and cut with scissors.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 10:
                Tie the new end of the bung, and continue stuffing. Freeze any spare haggises.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 11:
                Before cooking, pierce the haggis several times with a needle. Place in a pan of cold water, and bring to the boil. Simmer for 1 1/2–2 hours. 
                When ready, the internal temperature should read at least 74°C.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 12:
                Serve with mashed potatoes and swede. Or neeps and tatties.

    <em>Engineers With Passion For Food, We Plan, Work and Eat</em>
    <p>
        Everyone likes food. However, there are some people who truly love eating, just like us because of the relaxation and happiness 
        that something as simple as food brings can't be replicated. It's just like when something bad happens in your studies or work, 
        but when you eat your "comfort food," you somehow feel relieved and happier.  Another, example is sharing meals with family and friends, 
        where the conversation deepens and you feel the strong connection while enjoying eating. 
        These are just some of the reasons why food became our passion, because what we eat affects how we feel. 
        Food should make us feel good. It tastes great and nourishes our bodies.
