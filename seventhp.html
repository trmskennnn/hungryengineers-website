            <h2>Kimchi: South Korea's National Dish</h2>
            <p>
                    Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish whose components can vary but usually include some combination of vegetables, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, salt, and fish sauce. The mix is pickled and fermented,
                 which was originally a way to preserve the vegetables for the winter months. Cabbage is the most common vegetable used to make kimchi although carrots, radish, cucumber, and scallions are also 
                 frequently used, too. There are hundreds of kimchi recipes that vary depending on the region and season in which they are produced, and it's very easy to make it a vegan dish by keeping all the 
                 ingredients plant-based.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    Kimchi is available commercially and isn't expensive, but it can be fun to put together your own based on preferences. It can take a little bit of time to prepare the vegetables, but like other 
                fermented foods (e.g., bread, beer, and kombucha), it's mostly a hands-off experience. It will develop its flavors and its nutritional profile during that process. Kimchi keeps for a while, making it 
                an economical, versatile, and easy-to-prepare food item to have in the fridge.

                Recipes/Ingredients: Kimchi

                <br/>
                <br/>

                1 Napa cabbage, cut into 2-inch strips

                <br/>
                <br/>

                1/4-1/2 cup kosher salt
                
                <br/>
                <br/>

                2 tablespoons garlic, minced

                <br/>
                <br/>

                2 tablespoons ginger, minced

                <br/>
                <br/>

                1 teaspoon sugar

                <br/>
                <br/>

                3 tablespoons water

                <br/>
                <br/>

                4 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes

                <br/>
                <br/>

                1 large daikon radish, peeled and cut into 1-inch matchsticks

                <br/>
                <br/>

                2 bunches green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>

                Procedures:

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 1
                Place cabbage in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. Mix thoroughly using gloves, if preferred. Place a heavy pot or pan on top with weights and allow cabbage to sit for 1-2 hours until wilted and 
                water has been released.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 2
                Discard water after 1-2 hours. Rinse the cabbage 2-3 times in the sink until salt is removed and allow to drain in a colander for another 15-20 minutes.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 3
                Combine cabbage with remaining ingredients (through water) and mix. Using gloves, add the Korean red pepper flakes and begin mixing and rubbing flakes into the mixture. Add the daikon radish 
                and green onions to mixture, stirring to combine. 

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 4
                Once combined, place mixture in a jar pressing down and packing tightly so that the mixture is submerged in its own liquid. Place top on jar and allow to sit at room temperature for 2-5 days. 
                Place jar on a plate since the mixture may bubble over while fermenting.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 5
                Each day of fermentation, remove the lid to release gases and press down on the mixture to keep it submerged. You can taste a sample each day to decide if the level of fermentation is to your liking.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 6
                After 2-5 days of fermentation, store kimchi in refrigerator.

    <em>Engineers With Passion For Food, We Plan, Work and Eat</em>
    <p>
        Everyone likes food. However, there are some people who truly love eating, just like us because of the relaxation and happiness 
        that something as simple as food brings can't be replicated. It's just like when something bad happens in your studies or work, 
        but when you eat your "comfort food," you somehow feel relieved and happier.  Another, example is sharing meals with family and friends, 
        where the conversation deepens and you feel the strong connection while enjoying eating. 
        These are just some of the reasons why food became our passion, because what we eat affects how we feel. 
        Food should make us feel good. It tastes great and nourishes our bodies.
