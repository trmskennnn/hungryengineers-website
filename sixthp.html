            <h2>Curry Rice: Japan's National Dish</h2>
            <p>
                    Japanese curry (カレー, karē) is a dish that is hugely popular in Japan. It is readily available at various restaurants, and many households cook it at home too. As the curry is usually served with 
                rice, you would hear the term "curry rice" (カレーライス, karē raisu) mentioned often.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                   After importing curry from India, the Europeans invented curry powder so that the layman could cook curry without having to master the intricacies about spices. This form of curry was introduced to 
                Japan during the Meji Period (1868-1912), from which the Japanese adapted the dish to suit their tastes.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    The usual ingredients added in Japanese curry include potatoes, carrots, onions and meat. The sauce itself is usually made from curry powder or roux, which consists of a blend of basic 
                Indian spices. The typical Japanese curry is generally thicker in texture and tastes sweeter but less spicy than its Indian counterpart.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    The meat of choice is more often pork or beef. Survey results suggest that pork is the most popular meat for curry in eastern Japan while beef is more common in western Japan.

                Procedures:

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 1:
                Cut meat and vegetables into bite size pieces.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                
                Step 2:
                Heat oil in a pot, add meat and brown in oil. Take the meat out.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 3:
                In the same pot, fry onions for 8 minutes. Add carrots and potatoes, then add the cooked meat.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 4:
                Add water to the pot. After it boils, skim any fat, and reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 45 minutes until the meat becomes tender. If using a pressure cooker, cook for 15 minutes.

                <br/>

                Step 6:
                If you'd like to use the optional seasonings above, now add the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, apricot jam, and soy sauce. Let simmer for 10-15 minutes (cook longer if you'd like it thicker).

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 7:
                If you’d like to add the optional curry powder, stir it in just before serving.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 8:
                Pour the curry over rice.

    <em>Engineers With Passion For Food, We Plan, Work and Eat</em>
    <p>
        Everyone likes food. However, there are some people who truly love eating, just like us because of the relaxation and happiness 
        that something as simple as food brings can't be replicated. It's just like when something bad happens in your studies or work, 
        but when you eat your "comfort food," you somehow feel relieved and happier.  Another, example is sharing meals with family and friends, 
        where the conversation deepens and you feel the strong connection while enjoying eating. 
        These are just some of the reasons why food became our passion, because what we eat affects how we feel. 
        Food should make us feel good. It tastes great and nourishes our bodies.
