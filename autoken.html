                    I was once told by my elementary teacher, “Naniniwala akong may mararating ka sa hinaharap. Lahat dapat ng sinusulat mo patungkol sa’yo at sa gusto mo maging, siguraduhin mong 
                tutuparin mo ‘yan.” Since then, I always remind myself to have the courage to write all my experiences, the challenges I’ve faced in my life, and the life I want for myself in 
                all essays, autobiographies and even articles that I will do in the future. Through writng, you narrate a story and there will be no better narrator of your own story other than 
                yourself.

                    My name is Ken Allen Pillerva Tormes. I was born on the 16th day of October, 2003 and currently lives at Taywanak Ilaya, Alfonso, Cavite. I am the only child in our family. 
                The Lord gave me as a blessing to Airene Pillerva and Allan Tormes. I am currently in my second year studying Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Polytechnic 
                University of the Philippines-Alfonso Campus.

                    My mother was born deaf and my father is just like any other normal person. Though my mother is deaf, that doesn’t made her weak or a reason to give up in life. That condition 
                just made our family stronger. My father on the other hand, was from Camarines Sur and the most industrious person I’ve met in my life as he provides our needs by himself. 
                I also have my aunt who takes care of me whenever it is all about my school or needs in other things my parents can’t provide. She’s also very kind and often takes the 
                responsibility of my mother on dealing with things she can’t on her own. 
                
                <br/>
                <br/>

                    When it comes to me as a person, I usually just stay quiet in one place. I am not that talkative in person. Writing usually is the way I can say things or opinions and that’s 
                the reason I get fond of writing. I was part of my elementary and high school’s campus journalism. I am an editorial writer and I still write until now. Back then, I always join 
                different school’s press conferences whether it’s a district or division level. I won my very first competition when I was in fifth grade in district and then the division and 
                regional when I was in sixth grade. Writing has been my way to go since I sometimes can’t express myself in person.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    Going to my high school, I explored new things for myself, like sports. I was in my 9th grade when I first joined district meet in the sport called table tennis. First try 
                didn’t go very well but a year later, I got third place until I got silver medal. Sports not just keep ourselves disciplined and our body healthy, it also bonds us to other 
                players that results to friendships. I made friends through sports.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    On the other hand, when it comes to my favorites I usually don’t know what to say. I only had one favorite that is on the food. My favorite food is the kind of adobo which is 
                cooked with tomato sauce or ketchup. That sounds uncommon but I really do like that. My mother usually cooks that for me since I was a child so it became my favorite.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    Going on to pandemic, I really had a good pre-pandemic life. But after the Taal Volcano eruption, I ,just like any other had a harder time keeping up in the fast-paced tempo of 
                life. Staying at home at the beginning of the pandemic was not difficult for me as I am used to staying at home, but not being able to see people you meet everyday, things 
                you’re used to do outside and even just by being into a world that is socially distanced, hits different.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    There will always be times where you will be tested. Challenges that life lets you experience for you to grow as an individual. I also had challenges to face at my age. 
                Things that for others may seem to be common but for me, it tested me and challenged me to be better. I am an honor student throughout my life. When I was in high school, 
                I was determined to be the top student of the class. However, tiredness and other outside factors just made me relax and stay away on my studies, I didn’t perform well from the 
                start of my grade ten until the third grading. The moment my mother learned that my grades dropped, she bursted out of anger. She look at me with disappointment in her eyes. 
                Others may not understand, but for someone like my mother that did not have the chance to perform really well in her studies due to her condition, seeing me just wasted the 
                opportunities I freely get made her mad. The moment she look at me that time, that was the only time she didn’t recognize and avoided me for a month. I was frustrated at that 
                time but that made me focus more on studies. I want to not just disappoint my parents but also to have a bright future ahead.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    The quote written above was from my elementary teacher who discovered my ability in writing at that time. She was the one who motivated me in writing articles and the first to 
                made me believe I really am good at that. She taught me to write good and to express myself in a way others seem to be bored at.This may not only apply to me but to all people 
                who thinks that they are nothing. The only way to know your worth is to know yourself first. You are the writer of your own story. The only one who knows the next episode of 
                your life will be you. Appreciate yourself just like you appreciate others“Lahat dapat ng sinusulat mo patungkol sa’yo at sa gusto mo maging, siguraduhin mong tutuparin mo ‘yan.”, 
                making dreams turn into reality, that is my goal. I am Ken Allen Tormes, and this is the story of my life.

    <em>Engineers With Passion For Food, We Plan, Work and Eat</em>
    <p>
        Everyone likes food. However, there are some people who truly love eating, just like us because of the relaxation and happiness 
        that something as simple as food brings can't be replicated. It's just like when something bad happens in your studies or work, 
        but when you eat your "comfort food," you somehow feel relieved and happier.  Another, example is sharing meals with family and friends, 
        where the conversation deepens and you feel the strong connection while enjoying eating. 
        These are just some of the reasons why food became our passion, because what we eat affects how we feel. 
        Food should make us feel good. It tastes great and nourishes our bodies.
