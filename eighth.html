            <h2>Poutine: Canada's National Dish</h2>
            <p>
                    Poutine (pronounced poo-teen) is a dish consisting of French fries topped with cheese curds and hot gravy. It is native to Canada and little known in the rest of the world, though some restaurants in 
                other countries have poutine on the menu. Poutine is similar to American cheese fries or “disco fries.”

                <br/>
                <br/>

                    Poutine originated in Quebec, Canada in the late 1950s, and is now popular in all of Eastern Canada. Several communities within the province claim to have created poutine, such as Drummondville and 
                Victoriaville. The most popular story is that poutine was created at a small eastern Quebec restaurant owned by Fernand Lachance. Lachance had a specialty takeout item on the menu consisting of 
                French fries and cheese curds mixed together in a plastic bag. In 1957, a truck driver ordered the bag of fries with a side dish of gravy, dumped the gravy into the bag, and ate them together.

                <br/>

                    The origin of the word poutine is a source of some debate. Some believe it to be an adaptation of the English word pudding, as it occurs in Oscar Dunn’s Canadian French dictionary from the end of the 
                19th century with this definition. Some Quebec natives believe poutine evolved from the Provencal word poutingo, translated as “bad stew”. The word poutine began as Acadian slang for a gooey mess and 
                was first used to name an Acadian dish, poutine rapees - a blend of mashed potatoes, pork, and spicy sauce.

                <br/>

                    Poutine only has three ingredients, but connoisseurs argue there are many subtleties involved in preparing the dish correctly. The French fries should be made from potatoes that are hand-cut and fresh, 
                and should be fried in pure lard as opposed to vegetable or other oils. The gravy, also known in Canada as barbecue chicken gravy, is darker and thicker than gravy in America or other countries, 
                and must be served very hot.

                Recipes/Ingredients: Poutine

                <br/>
                <br/>

                1 quart vegetable oil for frying

                <br/>
                <br/>

                1 (10.25 ounce) can beef gravy

                <br/>
                <br/>

                5 medium potatoes, cut into fries

                <br/>
                <br/>

                2 cups cheese curds

                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>

                Procedures:

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 1:
                Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 2:
                While the oil is heating, begin to warm gravy.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 3:
                Place fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Cook fries in batches if necessary to allow them room to move a little in the oil. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to 
                drain.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 4:
                Place fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle cheese over them. Ladle warmed gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately.

    <em>Engineers With Passion For Food, We Plan, Work and Eat</em>
    <p>
        Everyone likes food. However, there are some people who truly love eating, just like us because of the relaxation and happiness 
        that something as simple as food brings can't be replicated. It's just like when something bad happens in your studies or work, 
        but when you eat your "comfort food," you somehow feel relieved and happier.  Another, example is sharing meals with family and friends, 
        where the conversation deepens and you feel the strong connection while enjoying eating. 
        These are just some of the reasons why food became our passion, because what we eat affects how we feel. 
        Food should make us feel good. It tastes great and nourishes our bodies.
