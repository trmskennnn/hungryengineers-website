                The basic hamburger consists of nothing more than a beef patty tucked inside a bread bun. However, this combination is rarely seen on menus anymore, as today, 
                a hamburger will include various additional ingredients like lettuce, tomato, onions, bacon, various condiments like mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, relishes, 
                and cheese in which case we are technically speaking of a cheeseburger.

                <br/>
                
                The beef patty made of minced meat can be either pan-fried, grilled or flame-broiled 
                and may consist of only meat and seasoning, or have various other ingredients that act as binders such milk, eggs, or breadcrumb. Synonymous with fast food, 
                hamburger, which may have more than one beef patty, almost always comes served with a side of French fries.

                Vegetable oil
                <br/>
                1 lb Ground beef or Chuck
                <br/>
                Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper
                <br/>
                4 Soft White Hamburger Buns (split)
                <br/>
                4 (1⁄4"-thick) Slices of a Large Ripe Tomato
                <br/>
                12-16 Slices Pickles
                <br/>
                4 Small Leaves Iceberg Lettuce
                <br/>

                Procedures:

                <br/>
                <br/>
                Step 1:
                First, oil a nonstick skillet, then heat it over medium-high heat. Divide the meat into four portions, then shape each into a 3 ½ “ patty. Season each patty liberally wth salt and pepper 
                and sear each until well browned on each side, about a minute per side. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for another two minutes, a minute per side.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 2:
                To make the burger, place a patty on the bottom bun and top it with a tomato slice, three to four pickles, a lettuce leaf, and an onion slice. Spread the condiments — mayonnaise, ketchup, 
                mustard, and/other — either alone or a combination, on the top bun and place it on the onion.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Step 3:
                Serve warm with either French fries, onion rings, or potato chips.

    <em>Engineers With Passion For Food, We Plan, Work and Eat</em>
    <p>
        Everyone likes food. However, there are some people who truly love eating, just like us because of the relaxation and happiness 
        that something as simple as food brings can't be replicated. It's just like when something bad happens in your studies or work, 
        but when you eat your "comfort food," you somehow feel relieved and happier.  Another, example is sharing meals with family and friends, 
        where the conversation deepens and you feel the strong connection while enjoying eating. 
        These are just some of the reasons why food became our passion, because what we eat affects how we feel. 
        Food should make us feel good. It tastes great and nourishes our bodies.
